    "description": "The Built Works Registry (BWR) is a collaborative project funded by a 2010 Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grant. The goal of BWR is to create and develop a freely available registry of architectural works and the built environment. The Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, Artstor and the Getty Research Institute (GRI) are the principal collaborators for this project. An international advisory council provided guidance on BWR development.\r\n\r\nThe BWR seeks to assist with providing a unique identifier for specific built works. Built work creators and locations are often identified in metadata records and controlled by community standards (e.g. LCNAF, ULAN, TGN, GNIS), but there is no community-wide list of the works themselves. Given this, the identification of architectural works and the built environment presented a unique challenge for scholars and catalogers, resulting in redundant compilation of works lists on the part of various catalogers and institutions. BWR is conceived and developed to address this issue by creating a shared community infrastructure for cataloging records of built works.\r\n\r\nBWR's goal is to aggregate existing work records originating from multiple institutional sources that identify and catalog structures in the built environment in different ways, and normalize those data into a single descriptive record. Every built work included in BWR is assigned a unique identifier number or BWR ID. The BWR ID serves the same purpose as the ISBN/ISSN system does in the world of publishing and provides a standardized system by which a built work can be identified. A BWR record includes a unique ID number, a preferred name and (when possible) variant names, location and geo-location coordinates.\r\n\r\nAs an international registry for the built environment, the establishment of and continued growth of BWR is a step toward the creation of a fully integrated and inclusive built works authority file, which at this time does not exist. In the services of this longer-term goal, BWR will serve as one of the core contributors to the Getty Research Institute's Cultural Objects Name Authority® (CONA). Over time, CONA will contain authority records for cultural works, including architecture and the built environment.",

Firstly, it pulls together information from the thousands of museum, archive and library websites and databases. Secondly, it serves this information up to media partners such as Google and the BBC to ensure that it is available to as wide an audience as possible.\r\n\r\nCulture Grid aggregates content from a growing variety of cultural institutions. Current contributors are listed on the detailed search page :\r\nhttp://culturegrid.org.uk/discover/advanced. Some specific sub-collections available via culture-grid are:\r\n\r\nBeamish Treasures,  Bede's World,  Bowes Museum,  Collect Britain,  Collections Base,  Commanet,  Cornucopia,  Cornucopia, DiadEM,  Cornucopia Egyptology,  Cornucopia Familia,  Cornucopia Inspire,  Cornucopia London Libraries,\r\n  Cornucopia Portraiture,\r\n  Devon Etched,\r\n  Dorset Coast Digital Archive,\r\n  Durham County Council,\r\n  English Heritage,\r\n  Exploring 20th Century London,\r\n  Bishopsgate Institute,\r\n  Brent Museum,\r\n  Bromley Museum,\r\n  Croydon Museum and Heritage Service,\r\n  Florence Nightingale Museum,\r\n  Geffrye Museum,\r\n  Burgh House and Hampstead Museum,\r\n  Bruce Castle Museum (Haringey),\r\n  Horniman Museum,\r\n  Jewish Museum,\r\n  London Transport Museum,\r\n  Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture,\r\n  Museum of London,\r\n  Redbridge Local Studies,\r\n  Redbridge Museum,\r\n  World Rugby Museum,\r\n  Fitzwilliam Museum,\r\n  Folk Archive Resource North East,\r\n  Geffrye Museum Test,\r\n  Hunterian Museum,\r\n  iSee Gateshead,\r\n  Kirklees Image Archive,\r\n  Lambeth Landmark,\r\n  Leodis,\r\n  Manchester City Galleries,\r\n  Michael UK,\r\n  Michael UK DCollections,\r\n  Michael UK Institutions,\r\n  Michael UK PCollections,\r\n  Michael UK Projects,\r\n  Michael UK Service,\r\n  MLA Institutions,\r\n  Picture the Past,\r\n  Portable Antiquities,\r\n  Sense of Place South East,\r\n  Seven Stories,\r\n  Tyne and Wear Imagine\r\n\r\n### Access\r\n\r\nThe Culture Grid content is best thought of, like most repositories, as a constantly expanding stream of content rather than something that is versioned in discrete chunks. Access is via the OAIPMH protocol which can be used to download the full set of culture grid records, and to obtain change-sets of records updated since the last OAI harvest.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nNot clear. Website states: \r\n\r\n> Copyright © Collections Trust 2009. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nContent is aggregated and preserved from a number of host organisations and services and made public by the grid. Culture-Grid itself acts as a referetory and is trying to clarify licensing with each data provider. Generally, the metadata is freely available although the content the metadata points back to will be licensed differently. Each individual metadata record has a license property. By default CG Content is licensed CC-nc-nd license, but users should check on a per record basis. It is possible to filter searches by license (dcterms.license). For OAI, developers would need to check license by license. Use of OAI to gather updates would alert harvesters to re-licensed records.\r\n\r\nThe Copyright statement on the site most likely refers to the site content rather than the culture grid content.",

In order to achieve this the BIBFRAME and the MARC descriptions are cross linked. Knowing the BIBFRAME URI of an instance:\r\n\r\n[http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563](http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563)\r\n\r\none can get the MARC description by appending \".opac\" to the URI:\r\n\r\n[http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac](http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac).\r\n\r\nKnowing the permalink of an OPAC record \r\n\r\n[http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563)\r\n\r\none can get the BIBRAME description in HTML format by appending .rdf to it:\r\n\r\n[http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf).\r\n\r\nOther formats can also be invoked by appending the following extensions:\r\n.rdf-ttl, .rdf-nt, .rdf-json, .rdf-jsonld, and .rdf-rdf. The .rdf-rdf extentsion gives back the rdf-xml format.\r\n\r\nClicking the BIBFRAME icon in the OPAC also leads to the BIBFRAME description.\r\n\r\nThe OPAC pages also support the link rel discovery service in order for the crawlers and other programs to find the RDF descriptions in different formats automatically.\r\n\r\nThe project was carried out in partnership with @Cult srl., Italy (MARC BIBFRAME conversion) and Monguz Ltd., Hungary (OPAC modification). We also used some parts of the ALIADA open source tool.\r\n\r\nThe @Cult MARC21 BIBFRAME conversion have the following main features:\r\n\r\n- Work recognition\r\n- Entity recognition\r\n- Name entities are linked to external datasets.\r\n\r\nThe BIBFRAME dataset will be updated periodically as BIBFRAME and the conversion evolves.

    "title": "Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND)",
    "description": "GND stands for \"Gemeinsame Normdatei\" (Integrated Authority File) and offers a broad range of elements to describe authorities. The GND originates from the German library community and aims to solve the name ambiguity problem in the library world. Corresponding data is usually expressed in a customized MARC 21 Authority Format (GND MARC Format) which is quite domain specific and is not used beyond the library and publisher world. The GND ontology tries to bridge this gap by providing a format specification for the usage in the semantic web.\r\n\r\nThe need for name disambiguity and entries having an authoritative character is an issue that concerns a lot more communities than the library world. In a growing information society the unique identification and linking of persons, places and other authorities becomes more and more important. The GND Ontology aims to transfer the made experience from libraries to the web community by providing a vocabulary for the description of differentiated and undifferentiated persons, conferences or events, corporate bodies, places or geographic names, subject headings, and works.\r\n\r\nTo ensure compatibility aspects the GND ontology aligns a number of already established vocabularies like the FOAF vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe GND is a young specification that probably will underlie certain smaller changes. However, the currently defined classes and properties have a status of stability. But we also expect the introduction of additional elements caused by newly upcoming requirements within the community. From January 2014 on, the Linked Data Service of the German National Library (DNB) will issue scheduled releases and will be integrated in the export releases of the other formats. Changes to the conversion and to the data modelling will be made in January, May and September. Changes will be notified in advance via the Linked Data Service mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/lds) and the Integrated\r\nAuthority File GND Ontology mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/gnd-ontology). Please subscribe if you are interested in receiving information about future developments in DNB Linked Data Services.\r\nIn a schedule corresponding to the export releases, updated dumps of the authority and bibliographic data in RDF/XML and Turtle will be available for download in February, June and October.\r\n\r\nThe authors welcome comments on this document, preferably via the public GND ontology list; publicarchives are available. \r\n\r\nThe Integrated Authority File\r\n\r\nThe \"Gemeinsame Normdatei\" (GND, Integrated Authority File) brings together the content of the former Corporate Body Authority File GKD (Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei), the Name Authority File PND (Personennamendatei), the Subject Headings Authority File SWD (Schlagwortnormdatei) and the Uniform Title File of the Deutsches Musikarchiv EST file (Einheitssachtitel-Datei ) to form an integrated authority file.\r\n\r\nThe target has therefore been reached of setting up an authority file which covers all types of entities and which serves as a common, authoritative reference system for libraries' bibliographic data and for the cataloging data of other authority file users such as archives, museums, projects, scientific and cultural institutions. All library networks in the German-speaking countries and the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) are involved in the GND project alongside the German National Library.\r\n\r\nThe GND should consign to the past problems arising from different formats, parallel storage of data records and different rules for descriptive and subject cataloging.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the GND is to form a modern, web-compatible authority file which is capable of networking the wide range of resources and information held by libraries and other cultural institutions in the German-speaking countries and making these accessible to users. To approach a web-compatible authority file we also provide the GND as linked data. Therefore we developed an independent GND specific vocabulary (GND Ontology) that almost completely covers the offered GND concepts provided in MARC 21. ",

If these topics attract you, youll be happy to learn Oklahoma property prices are extremely low. \n\nOklahoma \n\nNative Americans and their culture seriously affect Oklahoma, once called the Indian Territory. That give an original slow paced life to the state with even Oklahoma City experience less busy than most cities. As to the geography, plains make-up much of their state, but rolling hills is found around the northern areas of Tulsa. Lakes is found throughout the state, which provide plenty of opportunities for fishing, climbing and outdoor activities. All and all, Oklahoma supplies a peaceful, cheap move alternative for potential homeowners. \n\nOklahoma City \n\nOklahoma City is typical of the Midwestern city and is the greatest city within the state. The town has seen a revitalization effort, but nevertheless maintains a specific relaxed atmosphere that is unique to their state. To learn additional info, you might require to look at: <a href=\"http://www.roofing-companies.com/\">roofers edmond</a>. Regrettably, Oklahoma City was also the location of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995. Galleries and memorials have been put up in remembrance for that loss of life. \n\nTulsa \n\nTulsa can be an unusual city because of two diverse influences. On one hand, Tulsa includes a pretty amazing art motion involving building structure, museums and art galleries. On the other hand, Tulsa can be an excessively conservative Christian community and is usually regarded as the center of the Bible-belt. Dig up more on a related website by clicking <a href=\"http://www.roofing-companies.com/service.php\">here</a>. Despite these apparent contrasts, everything meshes incredibly well. \n\nOklahoma Real Estate \n\nOklahoma real estate prices are generally on the low-end of national prices. Dig up more on this related article directory by visiting <a href=\"http://www.roofing-companies.com/testimonials.php\">site</a>. An average of a single-family house in Oklahoma City and the suburbs will cost $185,000. The same house will be approximately $145,000 in Tulsa. \n\nWith such low rates, one cant expect to visit a soaring appreciation rate for Oklahoma real-estate.

    "description": "From the website:\r\n\r\n> What is MIDAS?\r\n\r\n> MIDAS sets out an agreed list of the items or 'units' of information that should be included in an inventory or other systematic record of the historic environment. These units of information are grouped together under broad headings or 'information schemes'. These cover areas such as Monument Character, Events, People and Organisation etc. It is a 'content' standard or 'metadata' standard for historic environment information. Standards for indexing under each 'unit of information' to assist retrieval of information are contained in the INSCRIPTION standard. See the FISH website for further details of INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n> Why is MIDAS important?\r\n\r\n> A vast body of knowledge and understanding of the historic environment is held in a wide variety of 'inventories', maintained by national bodies of record, local authorities, museums, amenity groups, individual and university based researchers. To make the best use of this store of information, especially where these resources are available on the internet, it is important there is a shared understanding of what information should be recorded. MIDAS sets out that shared understanding, based on the experience of many of the key organisations involved in the collection and dissemination of information about the historic environment.\r\n\r\n> How has MIDAS developed?\r\n\r\n> MIDAS developed during 1996-1998 from the work of a committee set up to co-ordinate standards across English national and local inventories. That work is now taken forward under the auspices of FISH, with a view to extending the MIDAS standard to be relevant to other regions in the U.K. and Ireland.\r\n\r\n> A second edition of MIDAS is now planned. You can find out more about current developments on the MIDAS updates page.\r\n\r\n> How should MIDAS be used?\r\n\r\n> MIDAS can be used to plan the content of a new inventory, for example to support a new recording project, or to audit the existing content of an inventory, and identify any useful additional information. MIDAS is designed to be an open standard, that can be applied in a variety of ways to different sorts of inventory records.\r\n\r\n> Who is MIDAS for?\r\n\r\n> MIDAS is intended to be used by a wide variety of heritage projects including:\r\n * Local societies and amenity groups.\r\n * University based research projects or individual studies.\r\n * Professional heritage managers.\r\n * National thematic study groups.\r\n\r\n> What is in MIDAS?\r\n\r\n> MIDAS contains both the standard, and a manual to assist in the application of the standard to a variety of situations, plus worked examples of how the standard can be applied.",

    "description": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA1\r\n\r\n  This archive contains 18,592 scientific publications totaling\r\n33GiB, all from Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\r\nand which should be  available to everyone at no cost, but most\r\nhave previously only been made available at high prices through\r\npaywall gatekeepers like JSTOR.\r\n\r\nLimited access to the  documents here is typically sold for $19\r\nUSD per article, though some of the older ones are available as\r\ncheaply as $8. Purchasing access to this collection one article\r\nat a time would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nAlso included is the basic factual metadata allowing you to\r\nlocate works by title, author, or publication date, and a\r\nchecksum file to allow you to check for corruption.\r\n\r\nef8c02959e947d7f4e4699f399ade838431692d972661f145b782c2fa3ebcc6a sha256sum.txt\r\n\r\nI've had these files for a long time, but I've been afraid that if I\r\npublished them I would be subject to unjust legal harassment by those who\r\nprofit from controlling access to these works.\r\n\r\nI now feel that I've been making the wrong decision.\r\n\r\nOn July 19th 2011, Aaron Swartz was criminally charged by the US Attorney\r\nGeneral's office for, effectively, downloading too many academic papers\r\nfrom JSTOR.\r\n\r\nAcademic publishing is an odd systemΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥the authors are not paid for their\r\nwriting, nor are the peer reviewers (they're just more unpaid academics),\r\nand in some fields even the journal editors are unpaid. Sometimes the\r\nauthors must even pay the publishers.\r\n\r\nAnd yet scientific publications are some of the most outrageously\r\nexpensive pieces of literature you can buy. In the past, the high access\r\nfees supported the costly mechanical reproduction of niche paper journals,\r\nbut online distribution has mostly made this function obsolete.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the money paid for access today serves little\r\nsignificant purpose except to perpetuate dead business models. The\r\n\"publish or perish\" pressure in academia gives the authors an impossibly\r\nweak negotiating position, and the existing system has enormous inertia.\r\n\r\nThose with the most power to change the system--the long-tenured luminary\r\nscholars whose works give legitimacy and prestige to the journals, rather\r\nthan the other way around--are the least impacted by its failures. They\r\nare supported by institutions who invisibly provide access to all of the\r\nresources they need. And as the journals depend on them, they may ask\r\nfor alterations to the standard contract without risking their career on\r\nthe loss of a publication offer. Many don't even realize the extent to\r\nwhich academic work is inaccessible to the general public, nor do they\r\nrealize what sort of work is being done outside universities that would\r\nbenefit by it.\r\n\r\nLarge publishers are now able to purchase the political clout needed\r\nto abuse the narrow commercial scope of copyright protection, extending\r\nit to completely inapplicable areas: slavish reproductions of historic\r\ndocuments and art, for example, and exploiting the labors of unpaid\r\nscientists. They're even able to make the taxpayers pay for their\r\nattacks on free society by pursuing criminal prosecution (copyright has\r\nclassically been a civil matter) and by burdening public institutions\r\nwith outrageous subscription fees.\r\n\r\nCopyright is a legal fiction representing a narrow compromise: we give\r\nup some of our natural right to exchange information in exchange for\r\ncreating an economic incentive to author, so that we may all enjoy more\r\nworks. When publishers abuse the system to prop up their existence,\r\nwhen they misrepresent the extent of copyright coverage, when they use\r\nthreats of frivolous litigation to suppress the dissemination of publicly\r\nowned works, they are stealing from everyone else.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I came into possession, through rather boring and\r\nlawful means, of a large collection of JSTOR documents.\r\n\r\nThese particular documents are the historic back archives of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal SocietyΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥a prestigious scientific\r\njournal with a history extending back to the 1600s.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the collection included in this archive, ones published\r\nprior to 1923 and therefore obviously in the public domain, total some\r\n18,592 papers and 33 gigabytes of data.\r\n\r\nThe documents are part of the shared heritage of all mankind,\r\nand are rightfully in the public domain, but they are not available\r\nfreely. Instead the articles are available at $19 each--for one month's\r\nviewing, by one person, on one computer. It's a steal. From you.\r\n\r\nWhen I received these documents I had grand plans of uploading them to\r\nWikipedia's sister site for reference works, WikisourceΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥ where they\r\ncould be tightly interlinked with Wikipedia, providing interesting\r\nhistorical context to the encyclopedia articles. For example, Uranus\r\nwas discovered in 1781 by William Herschel; why not take a look at\r\nthe paper where he originally disclosed his discovery? (Or one of the\r\nseveral follow on publications about its satellites, or the dozens of\r\nother papers he authored?)\r\n\r\nBut I soon found the reality of the situation to be less than appealing:\r\npublishing the documents freely was likely to bring frivolous litigation\r\nfrom the publishers.\r\n\r\nAs in many other cases, I could expect them to claim that their slavish\r\nreproductionΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥scanning the documentsΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥ created a new copyright\r\ninterest. Or that distributing the documents complete with the trivial\r\nwatermarks they added constituted unlawful copying of that mark. They\r\nmight even pursue strawman criminal charges claiming that whoever obtained\r\nthe files must have violated some kind of anti-hacking laws.\r\n\r\nIn my discreet inquiry, I was unable to find anyone willing to cover\r\nthe potentially unbounded legal costs I risked, even though the only\r\nunlawful action here is the fraudulent misuse of copyright by JSTOR and\r\nthe Royal Society to withhold access from the public to that which is\r\nlegally and morally everyone's property.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and to great fanfare as part of their 350th anniversary,\r\nthe RSOL opened up \"free\" access to their historic archivesΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥but \"free\"\r\nonly meant \"with many odious terms\", and access was limited to about\r\n100 articles.\r\n\r\nAll too often journals, galleries, and museums are becoming not\r\ndisseminators of knowledgeΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥as their lofty mission statements\r\nsuggestΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥but censors of knowledge, because censoring is the one thing\r\nthey do better than the Internet does. Stewardship and curation are\r\nvaluable functions, but their value is negative when there is only one\r\nsteward and one curator, whose judgment reigns supreme as the final word\r\non what everyone else sees and knows. If their recommendations have value\r\nthey can be heeded without the coercive abuse of copyright to silence \r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe liberal dissemination of knowledge is essential to scientific\r\ninquiry. More than in any other area, the application of restrictive\r\ncopyright is inappropriate for academic works: there is no sticky question\r\nof how to pay authors or reviewers, as the publishers are already not\r\npaying them. And unlike 'mere' works of entertainment, liberal access\r\nto scientific work impacts the well-being of all mankind. Our continued\r\nsurvival may even depend on it.\r\n\r\nIf I can remove even one dollar of ill-gained income from a poisonous\r\nindustry which acts to suppress scientific and historic understanding,\r\nthen whatever personal cost I suffer will be justifiedΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥it will be one\r\nless dollar spent in the war against knowledge. One less dollar spent\r\nlobbying for laws that make downloading too many scientific papers\r\na crime.\r\n\r\nI had considered releasing this collection anonymously, but others pointed\r\nout that the obviously overzealous prosecutors of Aaron Swartz would\r\nprobably accuse him of it and add it to their growing list of ridiculous\r\ncharges. This didn't sit well with my conscience, and I generally believe\r\nthat anything worth doing is worth attaching your name to.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in hearing about any enjoyable discoveries or even useful\r\napplications which come of this archive.\r\n\r\n- ---- \r\nGreg Maxwell - July 20th 2011\r\ngmaxwell@gmail.com  Bitcoin: 14csFEJHk3SYbkBmajyJ3ktpsd2TmwDEBb\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\r\n\r\niEYEARECAAYFAk4nlfwACgkQrIWTYrBBO/pK4QCfV/voN6IdZRU36Vy3xAedUMfz\r\nrJcAoNF4/QTdxYscvF2nklJdMzXFDwtF\r\n=YlVR\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",

    "description": "<p>Use of public libraries, Visits to museums and galleries and Engagement in the arts.\n</p>\n<p>This workbook contains baselines for NI9, 10 and 11 for all upper-tier local authorities. Percentage is weighted. This is the best estimate of adult usage/participation in the local authority, and forms the baseline against which progress will be measured. All survey data contain a margin of error; this is also known as the confidence interval, which is presented as a range around an estimate. For this report the range has been calculated using a 95% confidence interval, which means there is a 95% probability the true percentage lies in the range given. The best estimate available is the mid-point. Assuming a normal distribution, the actual figure is most likely to be around the mid-point but it could be at either end of the range.\n</p>\n<p>A number of factors will affect the level of change required in order for the survey to register a statistically significant change. One of these is the number of interviews conducted – the greater the size the more sensitive it is to detecting change. Another factor is the baseline percentage, with those nearer to 50 per cent requiring more change to occur. The ‘minimum detectable change’ takes these factors into account to indicate the minimum percentage point change required between the baseline estimate and the final estimate to record a statistically significant  increase in usage/participation. This calculation assumes that the number of interviews conducted in the assessment year is not less than in the baseline year.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\n</p>\n<p>Libaries (used for NI9) measures the percentage of adults in a LA who have used a public library service in the past 12 months.

    "description": "VIAF (Virtual International Autority File) is an OCLC dataset and service -- built in cooperation with national libraries and other partners -- that virtually combines multiple LAM (Library Archives Museum) name authority files into a single name authority service. Put simply it is a large database of people and organizations that occur in library catalogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIAF is a joint project of 20  national libraries, implemented and hosted by OCLC. The project's goal is to lower the cost and increase the utility of library authority files by matching and linking the authority files of national libraries, and then making that information available on the Web.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nThe data is released under Open Data Commons Attribution license. Attribution is requested as follows:\r\n\r\n> Adherence to ODC Attribution instructions for the correct assertion of attribution is encouraged. The preferred form of attribution for VIAF is:\r\n>\r\n> \"This [title of report or article or dataset] contains information from VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) which is made available under the ODC Attribution License.\"\r\n> \r\n> Special cases: In circumstances where providing the full attribution statement above is not technically feasible, the use of canonical VIAF URIs is adequate to satisfy Section 4.3 of the ODC Attribution License.\r\n\r\n#### Older information preserved for archival purposes\r\n\r\nOCLC is currently in discussion with partners about how to license material. [Message from Thom Hickey, OCLC Chief Scientist](http://groups.google.com/group/nyt_linked_open_data/browse_thread/thread/46ea00276e3d5a2e#) on public Google Groups mailing list in January 2010 states:\r\n\r\n> VIAF is a joint project with the contributing institutions and OCLC doesn?t claim any rights to the data beyond what the group has.  Unfortunately the group as a whole has problems coming up with a statement of exactly what is permitted.  In lieu of that, our position is that the data on the site is freely available for use through the APIs, although if someone wants a copy of the whole thing they would have to apply to the VIAF consortium (they could do that through me or Barbara Tillett at LC).  Along those same lines, if someone is going to have substantial activity against VIAF (multiple queries/second) we?d like to know about it ahead of time. \r\n\r\n> Over the next few months we will be working on a better statement of what?s permitted, but our intention is to make the data as freely available as possible (even to the NYT). \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther update from Thom Hickey:\r\n(http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2011/03/use-of-viaf.html)\r\n\r\n> I responded to a recent blog post on LibraryThing which mentioned restrictions on the use of VIAF and its relationship to the LC authority file.\r\n\r\n> In fact, VIAF is open for use by anyone.  Here's what I said about the use of VIAF:\r\n\r\n> VIAF is a project led by LC, the French and German national libraries and OCLC. There are no restrictions on its use. Dumps of the complete file are available, but need the approval of the project leaders.\r\n\r\n> VIAF is not designed to replace the LC/NACO authority file, but rather is built from it and a number of similar files.\r\n\r\n> I hope that is clear.  We really do want people to use VIAF!\r\n\r\nGood news, but no explicit license or complete dumps freely available without asking, so not (yet) OKD compliant ",
